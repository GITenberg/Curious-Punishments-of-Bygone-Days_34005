description: In Curious Punishments of Bygone Days, the punishment did not always
  fit the crime, as this fine old illustrated history of wrath and righteousness shows.
  One of the earliest institutions in every New England community was a pair of stocks.
  The first public building was a meeting house, but often before any house of God
  was built, the devil got his restraining engine. And who were the heinous criminals
  that the righteous put in the stocks? The punishment generally, in England and America
  both, was for petty thieves, unruly servants, Sabbath-breakers, revilers, gamblers,
  drunkards, ballad-singe.
